		[ ] Method to unload all the memory store service
		[ ] Method to dump the state in the memory state service (e.g. domains, clusters, etc.)
		[ ] Function memmoization for queries. Allows de developer to define a time interval where the query result
		    is cached. This depends on the input parameters of the query, caching is based on input parameters.
		[ ] Customized data CRUD operations pipeline. Allow the developer/power user to define a custom processing
		    flow for the CRUD operations.
		[ ] Import mechanism for data domains, including partial imports. Partial imports are for example, add
		    a new data entity to an already defined data cluster.
